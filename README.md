## Installation

**Recommended — install as a tool with uv:**

```bash
uv tool install jujumate
```

**Or with pipx:**

```bash
pipx install jujumate
```

JujuMate reads your existing Juju configuration from `~/.local/share/juju/` automatically — no extra setup needed if `juju` is already working.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
jujumate
```

On first launch JujuMate connects to your current Juju controller and auto-selects your current model. Use the keyboard shortcuts below to navigate.

## Views

### Status
The main view. Displays a full `juju status`-style breakdown of the selected model:
- **Applications** — name, charm, channel, revision, units, status and workload message
- **Units** — workload/agent status, machine or pod, address, ports
- **Machines** — id, state, address, instance, base, AZ *(IaaS models only)*
- **SAAS** — consumed remote offers and their status
- **Offers** — cross-model offers with active/total connection counts
- **Integrations** — all relations (peer, regular and cross-model)

### Offers browser (`Shift+O`)
Lists all offers across every model in the current controller. Select an offer to see:
- Model, URL, application, charm, description and access level
- Endpoint details (name, interface, role)
- Live consumer list — scans all known controllers to find which models and applications are consuming the offer

### Secrets browser (`Shift+S`)
Lists all secrets visible in the current model. Select a secret to see its metadata (owner, revision, rotation policy, timestamps).

### Relation Data inspector
Press `Enter` on any relation in the Status tab to open a databag viewer showing the application-level and unit-level relation data for both sides of the relation.

### App Config viewer
Press `Enter` on any application in the Status tab to inspect its current configuration values.

## Configuration

JujuMate is configured via `~/.config/jujumate/config.yaml`. All fields are optional.

```yaml
# ~/.config/jujumate/config.yaml

theme: ubuntu               # Theme name (default: ubuntu)
refresh_interval: 5         # Seconds between auto-refresh (default: 5)
default_controller: prod    # Controller to use (default: current Juju controller)
log_file: ~/.local/state/jujumate/jujumate.log
log_level: INFO             # DEBUG | INFO | WARNING | ERROR | CRITICAL
```

---

## Themes

JujuMate ships with five built-in themes: **`ubuntu`** (default), **`dark`**, **`monokai`**, **`solarized-dark`** and **`spacemacs`**.

Press `T` at any time to open the live theme switcher and preview themes before applying them.

To create a custom theme, add a YAML file to `~/.config/jujumate/themes/`:

```yaml
# ~/.config/jujumate/themes/mytheme.yaml
name: mytheme
primary: "#FF6600"
secondary: "#003366"
background: "#1a1a2e"
surface: "#16213e"
dark: true
```

Then set it in your config:

```yaml
theme: mytheme
```

Available fields: `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `background`, `surface`, `panel`, `warning`, `error`, `success`, `foreground`, `dark`.

User themes override built-in themes with the same name.
